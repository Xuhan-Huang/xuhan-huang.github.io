# About Me

Hello! I'm Xuhan Huang, a senior mathematics student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) and Prof. [Zhongxiang Dai](https://daizhongxiang.github.io/). Currently, I am a research intern at Shanghai AI Lab, mentored by Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/).

My research goal is to build verifiably safe and aligned AI. I believe that the path to trustworthy artificial intelligence lies in moving from today's empirical, feedback-based systems to a new paradigm grounded in the mathematical certainty of formal languages.

Formal languages offer what I call **rigorous verifiability**—the ability to automatically and objectively prove that a system's behavior aligns with its specifications. This transforms AI development by providing two key advantages: a perfect signal for scalable training and a direct pathway to provable safety. My work aims to leverage these properties to mature AI safety from an empirical art into a rigorous science.

### My Research Philosophy
*   Problem First: I believe that *what* to solve is more important than *how* to solve it. My work begins by identifying critical challenges.
*   Principled Solutions: I work to understand problems from first principles. The deep, theoretical insight gained from this approach is what guides the development of scalable and practical solutions.

### Research Interests
1.  Scalable Formal Reasoning: Harnessing the perfect, self-contained signals within formal languages to train powerful and reliable AI agents.
2.  AI Safety via Formal Methods: Using rigorous verification to guarantee that autonomous systems operate transparently and without unintended behaviors, ensuring they align perfectly with user intentions.
3.  Compositional Generalization: Investigating how models can learn to systematically combine existing skills to generalize and solve complex, unseen tasks, for which I believe formal language reasoning is the ideal test bed.

# Beyond Research

I'm passionate about fitness and can often be found at the gym or on the basketball court. Feel free to reach out if you're ever looking for a partner for either!
